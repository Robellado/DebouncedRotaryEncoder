# DebouncedRotaryEncoder
A library for the Arduino & Teensy for using a rotary encoder as an input with embeeded debounce to avoid noise.

Based in the idea and work of David Johnson-Davies - www.technoblogy.com 

Complete description of his idea can be found in his web: http://www.technoblogy.com/show?1YHJ

I was searching a library for using a rotary encoder for my latest project and I found a lot of information on this topic but none of the existing libraries eliminate (without false negatives and positives) the effects of contact bounce. So I finally found that David Johnson-Davies idea that I turned into a library. I am using cheap and noisy, chinese mechanical encoders. With this lib, if I manually rotate them as quickly as I can, no steps are lost. The David Johnson-Davies approach ensure the consistency of the rotate direction checking if a clock transition is new (process it) or repeat (noise - ignore).

How to use:
1. Include the library (obviuosly!)

2. Setup an encoder: 

        DebouncedEncoder myEnc(pin1, pin2, max, min, cycle); 
       // pin1 & pin2: encoder pins; 
       // max: maximun value for the encoder count; 
       // min: minimum value for the encoder count; 
       // cycle: if TRUE, the encoder reset count to the min when reach max. If FALSE, hold the max value. 
  
3. Get the encoder position

        myEnc.getPosition()
       // It works better if attached to interrupt pin.
  
4. Optional: you can set the encoder anytime values this way: 

        myEnc.setPosition(value)        //int 
        myEnc.setMaxValue(newMaxValue)  //int 
        myEnc.setMinValue(newMinValue)  //int 
        setCycleMode(bool newCycleMode) //bool 
        
To do:
Sure that this code can be optimized, but it works!
